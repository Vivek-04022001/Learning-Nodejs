### 1 What is the Role of the V8 Engine in the Node.js Runtime?

**Answer:**
The V8 engine is a crucial component of the Node.js runtime, responsible for executing JavaScript code. Developed by Google for the Chrome browser, V8 compiles JavaScript directly into machine code, providing fast and efficient execution.

**Key Points:**

- **JavaScript Execution**: V8 compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling high performance.
- **Memory Management**: V8 handles memory allocation and garbage collection, optimizing resource usage.
- **Node.js Integration**: V8 allows Node.js to use JavaScript for server-side applications, benefiting from V8's speed and efficiency.

**Concise Explanation:**
The V8 engine executes JavaScript code in Node.js by compiling it to machine code, ensuring high performance. It also manages memory efficiently, making it integral to Node.js’s ability to handle server-side operations swiftly.

### 2 What is the Role of libuv in the Node.js Runtime?

**Answer:**
libuv is a multi-platform library that provides Node.js with asynchronous I/O capabilities through event-driven architecture. It underpins Node.js’s non-blocking I/O operations, making it possible for Node.js to handle multiple operations concurrently.

**Key Points:**

- **Asynchronous I/O**: libuv handles file system, DNS, network, and other asynchronous operations.
- **Event Loop**: libuv implements the event loop, which is central to Node.js’s ability to manage multiple tasks without blocking.
- **Thread Pool**: For operations that cannot be performed asynchronously at the OS level, libuv uses a thread pool to handle these tasks without blocking the main thread.

**Concise Explanation:**
libuv powers Node.js’s non-blocking I/O by implementing the event loop and managing asynchronous operations. It also uses a thread pool for tasks that require synchronous execution, ensuring Node.js remains efficient and responsive.

### 3 What is the Meaning of Node.js Process and Single Thread?

**Node.js Process:**
A Node.js process is an instance of the Node.js runtime that executes your code. It is represented by the global `process` object, which provides information about and control over the running process.

**Key Points:**

- The `process` object gives access to environment variables, process ID, Node.js version, and more.
- It allows for interaction with the operating system and control over the application lifecycle.

**Example:**

```javascript
console.log("Process ID:", process.pid);
console.log("Node Version:", process.version);
```

**Single Thread:**
Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop model. This means it uses a single thread to execute JavaScript code and manage asynchronous operations.

**Key Points:**

- Node.js uses a single main thread for executing code.
- The event loop handles asynchronous operations, allowing for non-blocking I/O and efficient concurrency.

**Example:**

```javascript
fs.readFile("example.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
console.log("This message is logged first");
```

**Summary:**

- **Node.js Process**: An instance of Node.js runtime running your code.
- **Single Thread**: Node.js runs on a single main thread, using the event loop for non-blocking I/O and concurrency.

### 4 What is a Thread Pool and How Does it Enable Non-blocking Behavior in Node.js?

**Thread Pool:**
In Node.js, the thread pool is a collection of worker threads used to perform asynchronous tasks that cannot be executed by the event loop alone. Node.js uses the `libuv` library, which provides the thread pool to handle such tasks.

**Key Points:**

- **Asynchronous Tasks**: The thread pool handles operations like file I/O, DNS lookups, and other non-blocking tasks that are not inherently asynchronous.
- **Default Size**: By default, the thread pool has 4 threads, but this can be adjusted by setting the `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` environment variable.

**Example:**

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

// Asynchronous task using the thread pool
crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 100000, 64, "sha512", (err, derivedKey) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log("Derived key:", derivedKey.toString("hex"));
});

console.log("This message is logged first");
```

**How it Enables Non-blocking Behavior:**

- **Offloading Tasks**: The event loop offloads CPU-intensive and blocking tasks to the thread pool, allowing the main thread to continue processing other tasks.
- **Concurrency**: While the main thread handles lightweight tasks and I/O events, the thread pool manages heavier operations in parallel, preventing the main thread from being blocked.

**Summary:**

- **Thread Pool**: A set of worker threads managed by `libuv` to perform asynchronous tasks in Node.js.
- **Non-blocking**: The thread pool allows Node.js to offload heavy, blocking tasks, enabling the main event loop to remain non-blocking and efficient.

### What is the Event Loop in Node.js?

**Event Loop:**
The event loop is the core mechanism in Node.js that handles asynchronous operations, allowing Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O.

**Key Components:**

- **Callback Queues**: Queues that hold callbacks for different phases of the event loop.
- **Phases**: The event loop has several phases, each handling different types of callbacks.
- **Expired Timer Callbacks**: Handled in the **timers phase**, these are callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout` and `setInterval`.
- **I/O Polling and Callbacks**: Handled in the **poll phase**, this phase processes I/O events and their callbacks.
- **setImmediate Callbacks**: Handled in the **check phase**, these are callbacks scheduled by `setImmediate`.
- **Close Callbacks**: Handled in the **close callbacks phase**, this phase processes callbacks for closed connections like sockets.
- **process.nextTick() Queue**: This queue has highest priority and executes callbacks scheduled by `process.nextTick()` before the next phase begins.
- **Other Microtasks Queue**: This queue includes other microtasks like resolved Promises, executed after the current operation and before the next event loop phase.

**Concise Summary:**

- The event loop processes different types of callbacks in distinct phases.
- **Timers**: Executes `setTimeout` and `setInterval` callbacks.
- **I/O Polling**: Handles I/O events and their callbacks.
- **Check Phase**: Executes `setImmediate` callbacks.
- **Close Callbacks**: Executes callbacks for closed connections.
- **process.nextTick()**: Executes before any other callbacks in the next iteration.
- **Microtasks**: Executes resolved Promises and other microtasks before the next phase.

### Event-Driven Architecture in Node.js

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, which means the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions, I/O operations, or messages from other programs. This architecture allows Node.js to handle numerous concurrent operations efficiently.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Event Emitter**: An object that emits events. In Node.js, many built-in modules use the `EventEmitter` class from the `events` module to handle events.
- **Event Listener**: A function that waits for a specific event to occur. When the event occurs, the listener executes its attached callback function.
- **Callback Function**: A function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when a specific event occurs.

### Example to Illustrate Concepts:

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Create an Event Emitter**:

   - Import the `events` module and create an instance of `EventEmitter`.

2. **Add an Event Listener**:

   - Use the `on` method to add an event listener. This listener waits for a specific event and calls the attached callback function when the event is emitted.

3. **Emit an Event**:
   - Use the `emit` method to emit an event. This triggers the event listener and executes the callback function.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Import the events module
const EventEmitter = require("events");

// Create an instance of EventEmitter
const eventEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// Define a callback function to be executed when the event is emitted
function onEventTriggered() {
  console.log("Event has been triggered!");
}

// Attach the callback function to an event named 'myEvent'
eventEmitter.on("myEvent", onEventTriggered);

// Emit the event named 'myEvent'
eventEmitter.emit("myEvent");
```

### Explanation for Beginners:

1. **Event Emitter**:

   - We create an `EventEmitter` object named `eventEmitter`.
   - Think of it as someone who can announce (emit) that something has happened.

2. **Event Listener**:

   - We define a function `onEventTriggered` that simply logs a message.
   - We tell `eventEmitter` to listen for an event called `myEvent` and to call `onEventTriggered` when `myEvent` happens.
   - Think of this as setting up a listener who waits for the announcement.

3. **Emit Event**:
   - We emit the `myEvent` event.
   - When `myEvent` is emitted, `eventEmitter` announces it, and our listener calls the `onEventTriggered` function.

### Summary:

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Efficiently handles concurrent operations based on events.
- **Event Emitter**: An object that announces events.
- **Event Listener**: A function that waits for and responds to events.
- **Callback Function**: A function executed when a specific event occurs.

This model is fundamental in Node.js, enabling the handling of asynchronous operations cleanly and efficiently.

### Explain Observer pattern?

**Observer Pattern:**

- **Definition**: Design pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of dependents (observers) that need notification of state changes.

- **Node.js Context**: Implemented using `EventEmitter`:
  - **Subject**: `EventEmitter` instance that emits events.
  - **Observers**: Callback functions registered to handle specific events.
- **Example in Node.js**:

  ```javascript
  const EventEmitter = require("events");
  const subject = new EventEmitter();

  function observer1() {
    console.log("Observer 1 notified");
  }

  function observer2() {
    console.log("Observer 2 notified");
  }

  subject.on("change", observer1);
  subject.on("change", observer2);

  subject.emit("change");
  ```

- **Functionality**:
  - Subject (`EventEmitter`) emits events.
  - Observers (callback functions) react to these events.
- **Benefits**: Decouples components, enabling scalable and responsive event handling in applications.

This pattern is pivotal in Node.js for managing asynchronous events efficiently, promoting modularity and flexibility in application design.

### What are Streams in Node.js?

**Streams**: Objects that enable continuous reading or writing of data, crucial for handling large data efficiently by processing it in chunks.

**Types of Streams**:

1. **Readable Streams**: For reading data.
2. **Writable Streams**: For writing data.
3. **Duplex Streams**: For both reading and writing.
4. **Transform Streams**: Duplex streams that modify data.

**Examples**:

- **Readable Stream**:

  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");
  const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("example.txt", {
    encoding: "utf8",
  });
  readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
  });
  ```

- **Writable Stream**:

  ```javascript
  const fs = require("fs");
  const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("output.txt");
  writableStream.write("Hello, World!\n");
  writableStream.end("Goodbye!");
  ```

- **Duplex Stream**:

  ```javascript
  const { Duplex } = require("stream");
  const duplexStream = new Duplex({
    read(size) {
      this.push("Hello from the duplex stream!\n");
      this.push(null);
    },
    write(chunk, encoding, callback) {
      console.log("Writing:", chunk.toString());
      callback();
    },
  });
  duplexStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
    console.log("Read:", chunk.toString());
  });
  duplexStream.write("Hello, Duplex!");
  duplexStream.end();
  ```

- **Transform Stream**:
  ```javascript
  const { Transform } = require("stream");
  const transformStream = new Transform({
    transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
      this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
      callback();
    },
  });
  process.stdin.pipe(transformStream).pipe(process.stdout);
  ```

**Benefits**:

- **Efficiency**: Processes data in chunks, reducing memory usage.
- **Performance**: Handles large files or data flows efficiently.
- **Flexibility**: Easily piped and combined to create complex data processing pipelines.

**Summary**: Streams in Node.js handle data flow efficiently by processing it in chunks, with types including Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform. They offer improved memory usage, performance, and flexibility.

### What is Backpressure in Streams?

**Backpressure**: Backpressure is a condition that occurs in streams when the writable side cannot process data as quickly as the readable side is providing it. This leads to a buildup of data, potentially causing high memory usage and performance issues.

**Key Points**:

- **Occurs When**: There is an imbalance between the data flow rates of the producer (readable stream) and the consumer (writable stream).
- **Implications**: Can lead to high memory usage and application instability if not properly managed.

**Managing Backpressure**:

- **Automatic Handling**: Use the `pipe` method, which pauses the readable stream when the writable stream's buffer is full and resumes it when drained.
- **Manual Handling**: Control flow manually by using the `write` method’s return value and listening to the `drain` event to resume writing when the buffer is available.

**Importance**: Properly managing backpressure is crucial to ensure efficient data processing and prevent memory overflow issues, maintaining application stability and performance.

### How Requiring Modules Works in Node.js

**Module System**: Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, with the `require` function to import modules.

**Steps in Requiring Modules**:

1. **Resolution**: Resolves the module identifier to an absolute file path, checking core modules, file modules, and node modules in the `node_modules` directory.

2. **Loading**: Loads the module based on the resolved path:

   - **JavaScript Files**: Executed in a wrapper function.
   - **JSON Files**: Parsed to a JavaScript object.
   - **Compiled Add-ons**: Loaded as compiled binary add-ons.

3. **Caching**: Caches the loaded module in memory for future use, ensuring performance and singleton behavior.

4. **Execution**: Executes the module code, and returns the `module.exports` object.

**Summary**:

- **Resolution**: Finds the module path.
- **Loading**: Loads the module content.
- **Caching**: Caches the module.
- **Execution**: Executes the module and returns `module.exports`.

This process ensures efficient and modular management of code in Node.js applications.

### Caching Exports in Node.js

**Caching Exports**:

- **Caching Mechanism**: When a module is required for the first time, Node.js loads and executes the module, then caches the resulting `module.exports` object.
- **Subsequent Requires**: Any subsequent calls to `require` for the same module return the cached version instead of reloading and re-executing the module code. This improves performance and ensures that the same instance of the module is used throughout the application.

- **Singleton Behavior**: Due to caching, modules act like singletons. If a module maintains state, that state will be shared across all files that require the module.

- **Immutable Cache**: Once a module is cached, changes to the module's `exports` object after it has been initially required will not affect the cached version. The cached object remains the same for subsequent require calls.

### Summary:

Node.js caches modules after the first `require` call, returning the cached `module.exports` object on subsequent requires. This caching mechanism enhances performance, ensures singleton behavior, and maintains consistent state across the application.

**Caching Exports**:

- **Caching Mechanism**: When a module is required for the first time, Node.js loads and executes the module, then caches the resulting `module.exports` object.
- **Subsequent Requires**: Any subsequent calls to `require` for the same module return the cached version instead of reloading and re-executing the module code. This improves performance and ensures that the same instance of the module is used throughout the application.

- **Singleton Behavior**: Due to caching, modules act like singletons. If a module maintains state, that state will be shared across all files that require the module.

- **Immutable Cache**: Once a module is cached, changes to the module's `exports` object after it has been initially required will not affect the cached version. The cached object remains the same for subsequent require calls.

### Summary:

Node.js caches modules after the first `require` call, returning the cached `module.exports` object on subsequent requires. This caching mechanism enhances performance, ensures singleton behavior, and maintains consistent state across the application.

### Notes:

- Node js runtime depends on V8 engine, libuv, http-parser, c-ares, OpenSSL, zlib to run javascript outside the browswer.
- Node js works in single thread, which means it can be block and doesn't execute the next process until the previous task was finished.
- Inside the single thread the execution follows a sequence of instruction :
  i. Initialize Program
  ii. Execute "Top-leve" code
  iii. Require modules
  iv. Register event callbacks
  v. Start event loop
- Event loop offloading some expensive tas to thread pool which has lots of threads inside of .
  - Additional 4 threads
  - Offload work from the event loop
  - Handle heavy tasks:
    - File system apis
    - crytpography
    - compression
    - dns lookups
- All the application code that is inside callback function (non-top-level code) will be execute inside the event loop.
- To make sure of non-block behavior
  - Don't use sync versionss of functions in you fs, crypto, zlib modules in your callback functionss
  - Don't perform complex functions
  - Be careful with JSON in large objects
  - Don't use too complex regular expression (e.g nested quantifiers)
- We can change the thread pool size using, by default we have 4 threads in our thread pool.
  `process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 4; `
- Streams : Used to process (read or write) data piece by piece (chunks). without completing the whole read or write operation, and therefore without keeping all the data in memory.
  - Perfect for handling large volumes of data, for example videos;
  - More efficient data processing in terms of memory(no need to keep all data in memory) and time(we don't have to wait until all the date is available.)
- Each javascript file is treated as a separated module.
- Node.js uses the CommonJS module system: require(), exports or module.exports;
- ES module system is used in browser: import/export;
- There have been attemps to bring ES module to node.js(.mjs)
